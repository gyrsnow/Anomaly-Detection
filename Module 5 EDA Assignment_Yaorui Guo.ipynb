    "## Business Insight\n",
    "- Outliers exist for every variable. However, not all outliers are fraud. The majority of anomalies are common business practices. Fraudulent actions are more likely to occur in the outliers because a fraudster wants to acquire a big quantity of merchants as soon as possible. We can more efficiently discover scammers by concentrating on the outliers.\n",
    "- Feature engineering has a big impact on the construction of the model. From the summary statistics, it can be seen that some feature engineering has a very huge score gap between the normal and abnormal clusters, while some of the gap is not so obvious.In particular, for the same type of characteristic works but taking different statistical indicators (mean vs. median). For this dataset, I prefer to use the median as benchmark of the ratio feature because there is a more significant difference in scores\n",
    "- The characteristics of credit card fraud are reflected in RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary), the number of purchases and the rise in monetary value in a short period of time. A shift in purchase patterns that do not match long-term purchase patterns for certain specific institutions or merchant.\n",
    "- The average method found the least number of anomalous data points, while the MOM method found the most anomalies. the AOM and MOA methods found very similar data points and anomaly scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitation\n",
    "- Limited by hardware and time, I randomly sampled 20% of the entire dataset. If the model can be trained with samples from the whole dataset, the model performance should be improved.\n",
    "- A very critical step in determining anomalous data points is how to determine the reasonable boundary. All we can do is to determine the approximate threshold from the distribution of the histogram, if there is a better way to help determine the threshold will be able to make the results better.\n",
    "- Although the model can be used to detect anomalies, we have no way of knowing exactly how accurate the model is. The determination of anomalies also differs between models, and different unsupervised models can be tried to decide on a better one."
